⚙️ Calibration Process

To ensure accurate measurement, we calibrated the system by measuring the output voltage of the Op-Amp and the current flowing through the entire circuit using two digital multimeters. The steps were as follows:

1. Data Collection:
   We recorded multiple readings of the Op-Amp output voltage and the total circuit current using the multimeters.

2. Python-Based Mapping:
   The collected data was processed using the Python script [`Function Generator.py`](./callib/Function Generator.py). This script was used to generate mapping equations that relate the microcontroller readings to the actual measured values.

3. Voltage Divider Note:
   Since the voltage was sensed through a voltage divider, the raw readings were already close to the real values. Still, we applied the same calibration process to minimize minor deviations.

This approach helped us improve the system’s accuracy in both voltage and current measurements.
